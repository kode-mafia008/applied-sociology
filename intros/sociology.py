#Applied sociology is the application of sociological ideas, concepts, theories and models to address 
# everyday problems or situations. These may arise in the workplace, in homes,in communities or in 
# organisations.The means and methods for artificial improvement of social conditions, on the part of man
# and society as conscious and intelligent agents.” -the term ‘applied sociology’ has been the most general
# and oldest way of identifying this definition given by Lester F. Ward in 1903. It utilizes “sociological 
# knowledge and research skills” to gain empirical knowledge. This knowledge is then used to inform clients,
# decision-makers, and the public regarding various social processes, problems, issues, and conditions to 
# facilitate their informed decision-making and improvement of life quality. Applied sociology includes needs 
# assessment, social indicators, evaluation and market research, demographics, and also “directed sociological 
# research” in education, work, medicine, military, complex organizations, and mental health- in its broadest 
# sense. (Perlstadt, 2007)

#!Origin of Applied Sociology 
#Lester F. Ward was the first to bring the concept of applied sociology into the discipline of sociology.
# In 1883, Ward published a book titled, ‘Dynamic Sociology or Applied Social Science,’ wherein he defined
# the ability of legislators and the government to bring an improvement in societal conditions by gaining
# knowledge of the social forces, applying this knowledge, and becoming social scientists. Ward was 
# strongly opposed to the idea of radical socialist movements and utopian reform that led to abrupt 
# changes. According to Ward, applied sociology paved the pathway for the application of sociological 
# principles by serving as a guide for political and social action. (Perlstadt, 2007) Therefore, through 
# his work, Ward aimed at establishing the groundwork for the distinction between causal processes and the
# plausible interventions that can be made in these processes to bring about social progress.

#As stated by Hegel, in order to understand and grasp a concept, it is important to know what it is not. 
# (Marx’s Socialism) Therefore, the next section of the paper carries a differentiation between applied 
# and pure sociology to facilitate the reader’s understanding of this subject.
